Your app should be able to complete these tasks:
- Add a new to-do item
- Mark a to-do item as done
- Delete a to-do item
- Edit a to-do item
- Display all to-dos in a list or a grid
- Filter between completed and incomplete items

### Bonus:
- Enable search for the to-do items
- Include animations
- Persist data using Contexts and/or Async Storage
- Call some public API (image, video, weather, clocks, up to you)
- Save data to a backend server (like firebase)
- Do some kind of sharing

## How to run the demo
1. First you just need to type your to-do in the textbox.
2. then to submit your to-do simply just click the "Add todo" button beside the textbox
3. if your to-do list is complete, simply click the to-do list that you just complete to mark it as completed.
4. you can edit and delete the to-do list by using the button on the right of your to-do list to edit and delete the to-do list.
