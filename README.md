Suggestions
Make it easy for us to try your app. Add instructions on how to run your demo. There's a section below you can fill in
Don't be afraid if you're still a newbie. We will judge what you built adjusted with your experience. If you're just starting out, but can learn fast. We want you :)
Make something fun. We love to party too! :D
You can use Expo or Vanilla React Native. Our codebase is Vanilla (Ejected from Expo) though. Here's to learn more about Expo workflows
Get used to coding in TypeScript
Be prepared to explain your decisions and your thought process in the next interview. We're curious about how you think! :)

Challenge
Joko is a very responsible and organized person. He writes down all his to-do items in a day. And clears all the things he needs to do before the day ends

Create a React Native app where Joko can keep track of the things he need to do in his day


Requirements
Your app should be able to complete these tasks:

Add a new to-do item
Mark a to-do item as done
Delete a to-do item
Edit a to-do item
Display all to-dos in a list or a grid
Filter between completed and incomplete items

Bonus:
Enable search for the to-do items
Include animations
Persist data using Contexts and/or Async Storage
Call some public API (image, video, weather, clocks, up to you)
Save data to a backend server (like firebase)
Do some kind of sharing
Somehow make this boring app fun! show some crazy pokemon animation or something :P
How to run the demo



====================================================================

(INSTRUCTIONS)

Run the RN app, the app should land on the Kosongkan screen, for that screen is supposed to show if there is no data in the list.
There should be a text form in the very bottom of the screen, which is used to input tasks to the list.
After you input the task, press the + button to the right of it. ( If the + button does not show, Iâ€™m pretty sure it would show a circle, press it instead, same function ).
Then you will be navigated to the todolist screen, which also has the input form if you want to add another task to the list.
In the todolist screen, each task will be displayed as one component, and collectively displayed in a column.
One task component has the ability to be given a checkmark (which for now serves as a mark as done) and a delete button to delete a task.
That is currently the entirety of the app.
