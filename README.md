- Add a new to-do item
- Mark a to-do item as done
- Delete a to-do item
- Edit a to-do item
- Display all to-dos in a list or a grid
- Filter between completed and incomplete items

### Bonus:
- Enable search for the to-do items
- Include animations
- Persist data using Contexts and/or Async Storage
- Call some public API (image, video, weather, clocks, up to you)
- Save data to a backend server (like firebase)
- Do some kind of sharing
- Somehow make this boring app fun! show some crazy pokemon animation or something :P

## How to run the demo

- Type 'yarn install' if using yarn, but 'expo install' is the same
- Install additional dependencies that used in the app:
- Type 'yarn add styled-components' on the terminal
- Type 'yarn add react-native-bootstrap-styles' on the terminal
- Do not forget to install the firebase configuration also:
- Type 'expo install firebase' on the terminal
- If all the instructions above have been done, you can start running the application:
- Type 'yarn start'
- You will be redirected to the localhost page on the browser
- Select the option on which device simulator you would like to run the application, or you can use the web browser
- If you are using iOS Simulator, make sure XCode is installed on your Mac
- If you are using Android Simulator, make sure the Android Simulator is installed
- If you wish to open it on your device, download the Expo application first on the devices
- On iOS, you can scan the QR Code instantly with the iOS Camera which provided in the terminal when you run the application
- Open Tab 2 on the screen, and start working with your to-do list!
