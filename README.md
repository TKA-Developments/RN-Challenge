## Challenge
Joko is a very responsible and organized person. He writes down all his to-do items in a day. And clears all the things he needs to do before the day ends

Create a React Native app where Joko can keep track of the things he need to do in his day

## Requirements
Your app should be able to complete these tasks:
- Add a new to-do item
- Mark a to-do item as done
- Delete a to-do item
- Edit a to-do item
- Display all to-dos in a list or a grid
- Filter between completed and incomplete items

### Bonus:
- Enable search for the to-do items
- Include animations
- Persist data using Contexts and/or Async Storage
- Call some public API (image, video, weather, clocks, up to you)
- Save data to a backend server (like firebase)
- Do some kind of sharing
- Somehow make this boring app fun! show some crazy pokemon animation or something :P

## How to run the demo
To run this React Native app, you can run this locally or from the Expo website.

### Running and building on your computer using Expo:

Be sure to have installed NPM and Node 12 LTS or greater installed, then run this on your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

Then in the root directory of the repository, run this:

```bash
npm start
```

A local webpage will be opened on your browser which will contain a QR code to scan on your mobile device.

Download the 'Expo Go' app on your mobile device and scan the QR code using your phone's camera, the app should open and run through the Expo app.



### Running from the Expo Website:

Alternatively if you're using Android, you can just download the 'Expo Go' app and scan the QR code from the public project page on the Expo website through this link: https://expo.io/@alifyandra/projects/just-todo-it

If you're using iOS however, you will have to opt for the first option.

  This screen contains components that consist of:

  - an Add Todo button that triggers a modal prompting user to enter a description for the new Todo item.
